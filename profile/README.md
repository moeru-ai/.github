### Project ~~[DATA-EXPUNGED]~~

As VoltAgent 1.0 no longer supports xsAI, we need our own framework.

It should be small and flexible enough to run in a browser and elsewhere.

Do you have the relevant experience, and would you be interested in contributing to this project? Feel free to reach out! (üëÜ Discord)
