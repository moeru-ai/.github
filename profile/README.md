If you contribute actively to two or more of our projects, we may invite you to join the Moeru AI org.

### [Project AIRI](https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi)

This project aimed to build the ultimate virtual AI lives within cyberspaces. We are currently targeting the recreation of Neuro-sama.

### [Project Citrus](https://github.com/moeru-ai/citrus)

This project aimed to develop a model that approaches Kokoro's performance while maintaining reproducibility and fine-tuning capability, and is ready for anime-style speakers.

### Project ~~[DATA-EXPUNGED]~~ (inactive)

As VoltAgent 1.0 no longer supports xsAI, we need our own framework.

It should be small and flexible enough to run in a browser and on other platforms.

Do you have the relevant experience, and would you be interested in contributing to this project? Feel free to reach out! (👆 Discord)
